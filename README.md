# Swift File Search 

Swift File Search is an Index based file Search Utility that searches one or more files on the Computer for occurrences of an input query and displays the results in the order of their relevance. The content in each of the files in search result can be viewed directly through the search tool without having to explicitly open it in an editor. It also provides a "UNIX find" like feature which can be used to fetch the list of files matching an input pattern.
